# Hey, I'm Newt 👋

Software engineer with a love for building things that work well. I've been writing code since 2008, and I still genuinely enjoy it.

I care about clean architecture, thoughtful solutions, and shipping quality software. I do my best work with autonomy and trust, and I always deliver.

## 📍 Where to Find My Code

I've moved my primary development to **Codeberg** because their values align with mine. I use GitHub and GitLab for fork development and contributions.

Most of my active projects are licensed under **GNU AGPL-3.0**.
